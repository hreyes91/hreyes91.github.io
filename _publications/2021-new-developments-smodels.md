SModelS is an automatized tool enabling the fast interpretation of simplified model results from the LHC within any model of new physics respecting a  Z_2 symmetry. In this contribution, we report on two important updates of SModelS during 2020: the extension of the SModelS' database with 13 ATLAS and 10 CMS analyses, including 5 ATLAS and 1 CMS analyses at full Run~2 luminosity, and the ability to use full likelihoods now provided by ATLAS in the form of pyhf JSON files. Moreover, we briefly explain how to use SModelS and give an overview of ongoing developments.
