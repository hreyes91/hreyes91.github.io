We present version 2 of SModelS, a program package for the fast reinterpretation of LHC searches for new physics on the basis of simplified model results. The major novelty of the SModelS v2 series is an extended topology description with a flexible number of particle attributes, such as spin, charge, decay width, etc. This enables, in particular, the treatment of a wide range of signatures with long-lived particles. Moreover, constraints from prompt and long-lived searches can be evaluated simultaneously in the same run. The current database includes results from searches for heavy stable charged particles, disappearing tracks, displaced jets and displaced leptons, in addition to a large number of prompt searches. The capabilities of the program are demonstrated by two physics applications: constraints on long-lived charged scalars in the scotogenic model, and constraints on the electroweak-ino sector in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.
