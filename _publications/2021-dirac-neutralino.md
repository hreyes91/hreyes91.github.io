Supersymmetric dark matter has been studied extensively in the context of the MSSM, where gauginos have Majorana masses. Introducing Dirac gaugino masses, we obtain an enriched phenomenology from which considerable differences in, e.g., LHC signatures can be expected. Concretely, in the Minimal Dirac Gaugino Model (MDGSSM) we have an electroweakino sector extended by two extra neutralinos and one extra chargino. The bino- and wino-like states bring about small mass splittings leading to the frequent presence of scenarios with Long Lived Particles (LLPs). In this contribution, we delineate the parameter space of the electroweakino sector of the MDGSSM, where the lightest neutralino is a viable dark matter candidate that escapes current dark matter direct detection. We then focus on the allowed regions that contain LLPs and confront them against the corresponding LHC searches. Finally, we discuss the predominant case of long-lived neutralinos, to which no search is currently sensitive.
