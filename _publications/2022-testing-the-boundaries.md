Normalizing Flows (NFs) are emerging as a powerful class of generative models, as they not only allow for efficient sampling, but also deliver, by construction, density estimation. They are of great potential usage in High Energy Physics (HEP), where complex high dimensional data and probability distributions are everyday’s meal. However, in order to fully leverage the potential of NFs it is crucial to explore their robustness as data dimensionality increases. Thus, in this contribution, we discuss the performances of some of the most popular types of NFs on the market, on some toy data sets with increasing number of dimensions.
