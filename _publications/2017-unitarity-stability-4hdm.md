In order to obtain a dark matter candidate we propose an extension of the S (3) symmetric 3-Higgs doublet model, adding a new scalar doublet, occupying all the irreducible representations of the discrete symmetry. To ensure stability of the dark matter particle we impose an extra Z (2) symmetry. We find the analytical masses of the scalar particles and constrain their values using stability and unitarity conditions.
