<p>
At the LHC, gluino-pair production is enhanced while squark production is suppressed as compared to the MSSM, and 
the decay signatures are altered by a more complex chargino and neutralino spectrum.
We investigate how this impacts current gluino and squark mass limits from Run&nbsp;2 of the LHC.
</p>

<p>
Concretely, we compare different assumptions about the electroweak-ino spectrum through four benchmark models, 
paying particular attention to the effect of the trilinear 
\( \lambda_S \) coupling, which induces a mass splitting between the mostly bino/U(1) adjoint states.
</p>

<p>
Among other results, we show that for large \( \lambda_S \) the additional 
\( \tilde{\chi}^0_2 \to f\bar{f}\,\tilde{\chi}^0_1 \) decays somewhat weaken the limits on gluinos (squarks) 
in the case of heavy squarks (gluinos).
Moreover, we compare the limits in the gluino vs.&nbsp;squark mass plane to those obtained in equivalent MSSM scenarios.
