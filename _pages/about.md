Welcolme to my personal page!

I am a researcher working at the intersection of machine learning and particle physics. My work focuses on developing principled statistical and generative modeling methods for high-energy physics, including normalizing flows, likelihood-free inference, and foundation models for collider data. I am particularly interested in building reliable, scalable ML systems for scientific discovery, bridging modern AI techniques with the demands of fundamental physics.
